# Ismael's Genetic Lab

Welcome, Ismael! This is the Genetic Lab where all your experimentation will happen!
Please create the following folders:

## Nexus ride project live 
http://nexusride.surge.sh/

* developer-log
* experiments
* projects

`developer-log` is where you will record all your work on your projects. These logs will become the outline of your blog posts. Your blog posts will also reside in this folder.

`experiments` will contain any sort of experimentation you need to do in order to better understand something. Think of it as the equivalent of a JSFiddle or a Gist.

`projects` this folder will contain subfolders to each of your projects. Keep it clean an organized, please!

Build and Learn! It's on your DNA!
